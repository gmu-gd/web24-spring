Welcome to Intro to Web Design! Please make an account on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a> and if you are using your own computer download the <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Github Desktop App</a> and a text editor. See the <a href="syllabus/">syllabus</a> for recommendations and guidelines for a text editor but if you don't have one, I would recommend <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>.
