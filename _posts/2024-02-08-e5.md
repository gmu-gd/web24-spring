#### E5: Wireframes

Create two wireframes for the home page of the site you used for your site map. The first wireframe should be created from the site as it looks on your computer (desktop size). The second wireframe should be created from the site as it looks on your phone (mobile size). You can create both of them sketched on paper, both digitally, or one of each.

Upload your wireframes to your site and include a link to the website you made the site map for.

##### Requirements:

* A desktop wireframe
* A mobile wireframe
* Two image files on your website
