### Description
A single serve website is comprised of a single page that only does one thing. You will come up with a concept and design for a single serve website and then build the website. The concept can be simple or complex but the site must only be a single page and serve a single function. The (fictional) URL of the site should help explain the concept and the content should help reinforce the URL. If you need a place to look at single serve websites go [here](https://theuselessweb.com/). That website is a single serve website that takes you to other single serve websites.
