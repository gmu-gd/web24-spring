#### Exercise 1: 20 Questions

Go to the example repository and click on E1: 20 Questions. Create a web page that answers each question asked. That means you will answer 20 questions total â€” 19 of your classmates questions and my question. The page will be simple and unstyled but should display the question and your answer in a clear way. You are welcome to find elements to use outside of what we talked about in class but do not style any elements. If you need a little help starting, check out [tutorial 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/t1).
