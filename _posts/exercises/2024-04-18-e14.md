#### Exercise 14: jQuery
Create a single page that has at least three unique interactions on it using jQuery. The interactions should each use a different mouse event to start the interaction and each mouse event should do something different. For example, a mouse click could change the color of an object but hovering could change the position of some text. The content of the page should be a list of your top five favorite somethings. That could be your top five favorite songs, movies, places in the world, colors, etc.

The interactions should not be hidden and should try to have some relevance to the content of your list.

##### Requirements:
* Functioning HTML, CSS, and jQuery
