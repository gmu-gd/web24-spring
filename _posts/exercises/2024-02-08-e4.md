#### E4: Site Map

Create a site map showing the structure and organization of a website. The website can be any site of your choosing but I would recommend a relatively simple site with only a few pages. You can create your site map in any software you choose but it needs to be done digitally. My recommendation would be to use Xd. Also include who you think the intended audience is and what the main action or actions the site is hoping a user will accomplish.

Upload a PNG of your final site map to your site and include a link to the website you made the site map for.

##### Requirements:

* URL for your website
* Site's intended audience
* Site's primary action for the user
* PNG of your digital site map on your site
