#### E8: Visualizing Responsiveness
Take 4 sets of screenshots of the home page of the website you used for E4 and E5. The screenshots should be of the full height, meaning from top to bottom of the page, and taken with your browser at widths of 1440px, 1024px, 768px, and 320px (or the smallest your browser width will go). Arrange the screenshots taken at each width in XD (or your design software) on an artboard that is the appropriate width and height. Make sure the screenshots overlap so that it looks like a complete recreation of the live site.

Export the artboards as pngs and upload them to your website.

##### Requirements
* 4 PNGs on your site
* Images are the appropriate widths (1440px, 1024px, 768px, 320px) and the height is as tall as the homepage is on the web
* Using the same site you used for E4 and E5. If your site for E4 and E5 was not responsive pick a new site that is responsive for this exercise
