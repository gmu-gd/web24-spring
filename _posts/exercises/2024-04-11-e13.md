#### Exercise 13: Make it Move (Optional)
Animate something on your drawing from E11. It can be something added to it or something existing.

##### Requirements
* At least one piece of the drawing animated in some way
* Should be a copy of E11, not added to it (meaning duplicate E11, name it E13, and animate something in there)
