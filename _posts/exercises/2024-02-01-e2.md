#### Exercise 2: Make the Grid

Using XD or other approved design software make 5 artboards that are 1440 pixels wide by 3000 pixels tall. On each artboard create a grid that could be used to layout a website. The grid does not need rows, only columns. Once you have 5 different grids, start adding some “content” to your pages. The content should be shapes (squares, rectangles, circles), no text or images. The shapes could represent images, icons, text, etc. or you could be making some formal compositions without any meaning to the shapes. Some shapes should be tall, some shapes should be short, some should be wide, and some should be narrow. The grid should be your guide for how your shapes line up and fit on the page. Do not ignore the grid. Keep in mind ideas about space and that every pixel of the page does not need to be filled.
