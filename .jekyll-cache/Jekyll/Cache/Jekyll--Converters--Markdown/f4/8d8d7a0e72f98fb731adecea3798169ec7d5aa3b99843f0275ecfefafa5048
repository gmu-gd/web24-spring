<p>Select a book from this <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/browse/scores/top">list</a>. Using the title, author, chapter title, and the first 1000 words, make 6 different layouts. Each layout should be unique in design but the content will be the same. Focus on contrast, hierarchy, and positioning and make considered decisions about the type you choose. The first three of the layouts will just be in black and white with no images and the second three you can use color and images if you want. Design some pages with one typeface and some pages with multiple typefaces. Try symmetrical and asymmetrical layouts and size, weight, style and other typographic concepts to create a well designed, readable page. All the layouts should use a grid to help with the layout.</p>

<p>Each layout should be on an artboard that is 1440px wide by however tall it needs to be to accommodate the content.</p>
