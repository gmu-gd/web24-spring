<p><strong>Option 1</strong> – Interactions Create a single page that has at least three unique interactions on it using jQuery. The interactions should each use a different mouse event to start the interaction and each mouse event should do something different. For example, a mouse click could change the color of an object but hovering could change the position of some text. The content of the page should be a list of your top five favorite somethings. That could be your top five favorite songs, movies, places in the world, colors, etc.</p>

<p>The interactions should not be hidden and should try to have some relevance to the content of your list.</p>

<p><strong>Option 2</strong> – Guessing Game Design and create a single page guessing game using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. The game should ask a user to answer a question and then react to that answer. This could be a game like Hot or Cold where the game is only over once the user guesses correctly or could be a one chance game like Rock, Paper, Scissors. The game should have a different answer each time the page is loaded, meaning that the game cannot be “Guess My Middle Name” and the answer is always “George” but it could be “Guess a Name” and that name is randomly generated from a list of names.</p>

<p>HTML/CSS - The page only needs two things, a question and a place where the user can input an answer. More might be necessary depending on the complexity of the game you are building. It should also be responsive.</p>

<p>jQuery - The jQuery should have some kind of variable, a way to check the input against that variable, and then an outcome or outcomes based on whether that input is right or wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Option 3</strong> – Plugins Find a jQuery plugin online and integrate it into a page. The plugin can do anything but it needs to be added to the page appropriately and function as intended.</p>
