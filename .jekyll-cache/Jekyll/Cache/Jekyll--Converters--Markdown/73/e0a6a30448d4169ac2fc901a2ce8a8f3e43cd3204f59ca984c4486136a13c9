<p>Read through each discussion post from your classmates and create a web page that answers each question asked. That means you will answer 20 questions total â€” 19 of your classmates questions plus one of your own. The page will be simple and use default styles but should display the question and your answer in a clear way. If you need a little help starting, check out <a href="/tutorials/t1">tutorial 1</a>.</p>
