<p>We will meet in person once a week on Tuesdays from 1:30 to 4:10 in AB 1021. The classes are required and during our sessions we will discuss work, complete assignments, and further our design knowledge. The class is scheduled to run for 15 weeks and you can expect to work for 6 hours outside of class each week.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>AVT 180: New Media in the Creative Arts, AVT 110: Digital Design Studio, or permission of instructor.</p>

<h3 id="course-description">Course Description</h3>
<p>An introduction to contemporary web design. Students gain hands-on experience with design issues specific to web-based forms as well as begin to write and understand the languages that make the web work.</p>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Building a website or web application is a multi-disciplinary design process that encompasses visual design, interface design, interaction design, content development, coding, as well as business strategy. Exceptional web design is attentive to these different facets whether it is viewed from the perspective of product design, graphic design, or industrial design. Every student stretches themselves in this course.</p>

<p>This hands-on course teaches students how to conceive, prototype, design, and build websites. In order to better understand the possibilities and constraints of browser-based design, participants of this course learn how to build websites using modern web standards. This is not a course that will teach students about building websites that use a CMS or framework like Wordpress, Squarespace, Bootstrap, or similar tools. All projects in this course will be coded from scratch.</p>

<p>Participants should finish the course with a working knowledge of HTML and CSS, improved web imaging, layout, and typography skills, and familiarity with more technical facets like jQuery and responsive design.</p>

<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Develop general design skills</li>
  <li>Translate print design skills to screen based applications</li>
  <li>Apply best practices for folder and file naming, organization, and structure</li>
  <li>Understand the process of designing and building a website</li>
  <li>Demonstrate knowledge of HTML and CSS syntax and structure</li>
  <li>Analyze everyday interactions on the web from a critical perspective</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="textbook">Textbook</h3>
<p>The textbook for this course is available for purchase/rent on Amazon and other online retailers but is also available as a digital copy through the Mason library. Instructions on how to access the digital copy are on Blackboard. There is also an associated website for the book at <a href="https://www.learningwebdesign.com/index.html">learningwebdesign.com</a></p>

<h3 id="programs">Programs</h3>
<p>There are many different programs available to use for the work in this class. The programs I will be using are highlighted but alternatives are also listed.</p>

<h4 id="design">design</h4>
<p><span class="command">Adobe XD</span>, Figma, Sketch, Illustrator, Lunacy. We will not be using Photoshop for design tool.</p>

<h4 id="coding">coding</h4>
<p><span class="command">Sublime Text</span>, Brackets, or other approved text editor. We will not be using Dreamweaver, Notepad, or TextEdit as a code editor in this course.</p>

<h4 id="other">other</h4>
<p><span class="command">Zoom</span> (holding class sessions), <span class="command">Slack</span> (communication platform), <span class="command">Github Desktop</span> (updating your website), <span class="command">Chrome</span>, Safari, or Firefox (viewing your website. Internet Explorer is not an acceptable browser for this class)</p>

<h3 id="work">Work</h3>
<p>This course consists of many shorter exercises, a few longer projects, quizzes, and discussion requirements. The exercises are to begin to familiarize students with specific concepts and ideas and the projects are a synthesis of the concepts and ideas we will cover. Quizzes will review information from the lessons and the discussion posts will be used for critiques and analysis of relevant topics.</p>

<h4 id="project-1-linking-narrative">project 1: linking narrative</h4>
<p>The structure of a website is equally as important as the design of a website. Getting from page X to page Y needs to be intuitive and simple. This structure also needs to be reflected on the back end. Create a site that takes the user through a narrative using text, links, and multiple pages. <a href="/projects">More information here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="project-2-website-for-a-blank">project 2: website for a [blank]</h4>
<p>Students will conceptualize, plan, and design a multipage website using one of several provided topics. The project will build off of the weekly lessons and end at a design for a responsive website. Each students project will be unique in content and form but be based on the same set of requirements. <a href="/projects">More information here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="virtual-meeting-guide">Virtual Meeting Guide</h3>
<p>A few points to guide our virtual meetings. These are not demands but a guide to help us have a more engaging and productive meeting.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Be on time.</li>
  <li>Even better, be early.</li>
  <li>Have your video on.</li>
  <li>Mute yourself when you aren‚Äôt speaking.</li>
  <li>Use the chat.</li>
  <li>Pay attention, don‚Äôt multitask.</li>
  <li>Try and be in a calm, quiet space.</li>
  <li>Be engaged and prepared.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="engagement">Engagement</h3>
<p>This course has an engagement policy instead of an attendance policy. Your engagement will affect your final grade (and, by extension, the quality of your work) for this course. You are expected to actively and passionately take part in this course in the following ways.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Attend class meetings (see 01 and 02 of the virtual meeting guide).</li>
  <li>Create things and be prepared to show them on time.</li>
  <li>Make things thoughtfully, intentionally, and with intensity.</li>
  <li>Meet all deadlines for handing in work and process.</li>
  <li>Actively participate in critiques both in class and out of class.</li>
  <li>Be curious about making things and the things your classmates make.</li>
  <li>Care about yourself &amp; your work, your classmates &amp; their work, and this class.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="weekly-schedule">Weekly Schedule</h3>
<p>Class is on Tuesdays. Most days we will meet for the entire time but some weeks we will have individual meetings or end early. All work is due the Monday before class by 11:59pm ET. This will allow me time to review before class and make sure you aren‚Äôt working at 3am. Time management is an important skill to master and, more importantly, you need to sleep.</p>

<h3 id="semester-schedule">Semester Schedule</h3>
<p>The <a href="/schedule/">schedule</a> on this site is an outline of what we will be covering this spring with due dates. It is subject to additions and subtractions.</p>

<h3 id="discussion-of-work">Discussion of Work</h3>
<p>You will need to take an active role in both the presentation and discussion of your work. We will review projects in a variety of ways and you are expected to be able to talk and type about your own work and give feedback to your peers about their work. The ability to discuss your work and other student‚Äôs work is a very important part of your education at Mason. Use this class to improve on those skills.</p>

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>Grades will be based on your quizzes (10%), engagement (25%),  exercises (25%), and projects (40%).</p>

<h4 id="quizzes-10">Quizzes (10%)</h4>
<p>Each week will have a 5 question quiz based on the topics covered that week. You can use any resources available to you during the quizzes and take them as many times as you want until the quiz is due.</p>

<h4 id="participation-25">Participation (25%)</h4>
<p>This percentage will be based on your engagement in the class which is explained on previous pages but will include attendance, discussion assignments, critiques, and participation in our virtual channels (Slack and Zoom). Be engaged in this course and its content throughout the semester and this should be an easy 25%.</p>

<h4 id="exercises-25">Exercises (25%)</h4>
<p>The exercises are graded using basic rubrics available on Blackboard and in the PDF syllabus. The rubric used is dependent on whether the exercise focuses on coding skills or design skills but both include your ability to follow the instructions of the exercise and your ability to submit it on time. The exercises are meant to be quicker, skill building tasks that improve your projects and knowledge of coding and design.</p>

<h4 id="projects-40">Projects (40%)</h4>
<p>Each project will generate two different grades. One grade will be based on your ability to submit the required, weekly checkpoints for the project. These weekly checkpoints use a simple rubric based on your effort, timeliness, improvement, and completion. The second grade will be based on the final project you submit and has a more extensive rubric. At the end of the semester you will have 6 total project grades that are all weighted equally for this 40%. The rubrics used for grading the checkpoints and projects are on pages are available on Blackboard and in the PDF syllabus.</p>

<h3 id="rubrics">Rubrics</h3>
<p>Exercises and projects use rubrics to grade. Depending on the type of exercise or project will depend on the type of rubric used. Generally speaking design projects and exercises use a different rubric than coding projects and exercises. The rubrics are available for you to view on Blackboard and in the PDF syllabus.</p>

<p>Students are expected to attend the class periods of the courses for which they register. In-class (including sections that meet online) participation is important not only to the individual student, but also to the class as a whole. Because class participation may be a factor in grading, instructors may use absence, tardiness, or early departure as de facto evidence of nonparticipation. Students who miss an exam with an acceptable excuse may be penalized according to the individual instructor‚Äôs grading policy, as stated in the course syllabus.</p>

<p>I explicitly reject white supremacy and racism and am committed to equity, justice, and democracy in society, on campus, and within my classrooms. No matter the name or label, anti-Black and anti-Semitic, and racist thought and action are antithetical to my mission and values as an educator. I condemn the divisive and intimidating tactics of white supremacist views.</p>

<p>I recognize that systemic racism is pervasive within our society and institutions, and pledge to combat it through receiving critical feedback on how I can be more inclusive and being more self-aware of my privileged identities. Including the use of collective teaching, programming, scholarship, and service. I want you, Mason‚Äôs students, to know that I am committed to fostering a classroom where everyone can learn without the chilling effects of bigoted views.</p>

<p>I am determined to uphold the University‚Äôs mission, which states that, ‚ÄúWe hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards as educators, scholars, and professionals,‚Äù and thus am committed to creating a culture of excellence, inclusion, and accessibility.</p>

<p>I welcome all members of our extended community regardless of their race, ethnicity, immigration status, religion, sexual identity, gender identity, socioeconomic status, political or institutional affiliation, and ability, and am fully dedicated to promoting a diversity of voices and views as an academic department.</p>

<p>I recognize that there is still much self- and systemic-work to be done to make the spaces of the University safe and hospitable to all and am committed to continuing to do that work. My door is open to any students seeking support or guidance.</p>
