<p>File naming and organization are important parts of making sure your files are easy to find both visually and while writing links. Download the files from the link on Blackboard and you will find there is a simple site with a terrible file structure. Rename these files something clear and simple and then organize them into a nice folder structure. The site has a main page and then 3 sub pages for an about page, a menus page, and a gallery page.</p>

<p>Once you have organized and renamed the files, take a screenshot of the new structure and post it to your site (Atomâ€™s sidebar is a great view). If you cannot get a view where all the files and folders are shown in one folder, take multiple screenshots or position multiple folders on the screen to show the structure.</p>
