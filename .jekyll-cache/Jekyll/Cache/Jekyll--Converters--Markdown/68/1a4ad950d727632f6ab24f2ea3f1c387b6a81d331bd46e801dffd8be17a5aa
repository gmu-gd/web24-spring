I"Ò <h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>You will conceptualize, plan, and design a multipage website using one of several provided topics. Each student‚Äôs project will be unique in content and form but be based on the same basic set of requirements.</p>

<p>Each topic has a specific set of pages to design and a goal for what that should accomplish. You will generate the content for each page by finding text and images online (or creating on your own) to use for each page based on that page‚Äôs goal.</p>

<p>The first step of the project will be the planning phase ‚Äî finding or generating content, coming up with a general concept, finding visual references, creating a site map and wireframes. Then you will use that concept and content to design the site. For this project you will design a desktop version of the site at 1440px and a mobile version of the site at 320px. This means you will have a design for each of the four pages at each size.</p>

<p>The topics you can choose from are <a href="#food">Food</a>, <a href="#art">Art</a>, <a href="#music">Music</a>, or <a href="#travel">Travel</a>.</p>

<p>Create a website for The Velvet Velvet, a fictional gallery. Every year, The Velvet Velvet features three to four larger shows about graphic design and architecture, with smaller monthly exhibits featuring work from local designers.

<p>In addition to the small and larger exhibits, one will find for sale a modest selection of books and magazines about graphic design, typography, and architecture from publishers all over the world.</p>
