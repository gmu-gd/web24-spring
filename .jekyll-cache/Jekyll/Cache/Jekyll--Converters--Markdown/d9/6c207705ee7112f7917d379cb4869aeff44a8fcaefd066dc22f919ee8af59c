<p>Create a drawing using only HTML and CSS of an object around your house. To do this you will make some divs, position them on the page, and then style each piece with CSS. The divs will then get layered and moved around to make your final drawing. Take a look at this <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/how-i-started-drawing-css-images-3fd878675c89">link</a> for a reference on how these might get set up.</p>
