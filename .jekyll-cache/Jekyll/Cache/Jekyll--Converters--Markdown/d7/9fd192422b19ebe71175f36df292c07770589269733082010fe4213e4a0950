<p>We will meet in person once a week on Tuesdays from 1:30 to 4:10 in AB 1021. The classes are required and during our sessions we will discuss work, complete assignments, and further our design knowledge. The class is scheduled to run for 15 weeks and you can expect to work for 6 hours outside of class each week.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>AVT 180: New Media in the Creative Arts, AVT 110: Digital Design Studio, or permission of instructor.</p>

<h3 id="course-description">Course Description</h3>
<p>An introduction to contemporary web design. Students gain hands-on experience with design issues specific to web-based forms as well as begin to write and understand the languages that make the web work.</p>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Building a website or web application is a multi-disciplinary design process that encompasses visual design, interface design, interaction design, content development, coding, as well as business strategy. Exceptional web design is attentive to these different facets whether it is viewed from the perspective of product design, graphic design, or industrial design. Every student stretches themselves in this course.</p>

<p>This hands-on course teaches students how to conceive, prototype, design, and build websites. In order to better understand the possibilities and constraints of browser-based design, participants of this course learn how to build websites using modern web standards. This is not a course that will teach students about building websites that use a CMS or framework like Wordpress, Squarespace, Bootstrap, or similar tools. All projects in this course will be coded from scratch.</p>

<p>Participants should finish the course with a working knowledge of HTML and CSS, improved web imaging, layout, and typography skills, and familiarity with more technical facets like jQuery and responsive design.</p>

<h3 id="objectives">Objectives</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Develop general design skills</li>
  <li>Translate print design skills to screen based applications</li>
  <li>Apply best practices for folder and file naming, organization, and structure</li>
  <li>Understand the process of designing and building a website</li>
  <li>Demonstrate knowledge of HTML and CSS syntax and structure</li>
  <li>Analyze everyday interactions on the web from a critical perspective</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="textbook">Textbook</h3>
<p>The textbook for this course is available for purchase/rent on Amazon and other online retailers but is also available as a digital copy through the Mason library. Instructions on how to access the digital copy are on Blackboard. There is also an associated website for the book at <a href="https://www.learningwebdesign.com/index.html">learningwebdesign.com</a></p>

<p><em>Learning Web Design: A Beginner’s Guide to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web Graphics</em> 5th edition by Jennifer Niederst Robbins ISBN: 978-1-491-96020-2</p>

<h3 id="programs">Programs</h3>
<p>There are many different programs available to use for the work in this class. The programs I will be using are highlighted but alternatives are also listed.</p>

<h4 id="design">design</h4>
<p><span class="command">Adobe XD</span>, Figma, Sketch, Illustrator, Lunacy. We will not be using Photoshop for design tool.</p>

<h4 id="coding">coding</h4>
<p><span class="command">Sublime Text</span>, Brackets, or other approved text editor. We will not be using Dreamweaver, Notepad, or TextEdit as a code editor in this course.</p>

<h4 id="other">other</h4>
<p><span class="command">Zoom</span> (holding class sessions), <span class="command">Slack</span> (communication platform), <span class="command">Github Desktop</span> (updating your website), <span class="command">Chrome</span>, Safari, or Firefox (viewing your website. Internet Explorer is not an acceptable browser for this class)</p>

<h3 id="work">Work</h3>
<p>This course consists of many shorter exercises, a few longer projects, quizzes, and discussion requirements. The exercises are to begin to familiarize students with specific concepts and ideas and the projects are a synthesis of the concepts and ideas we will cover. Quizzes will review information from the lessons and the discussion posts will be used for critiques and analysis of relevant topics.</p>

<h4 id="project-1-linking-narrative">project 1: linking narrative</h4>
<p>The structure of a website is equally as important as the design of a website. Getting from page X to page Y needs to be intuitive and simple. This structure also needs to be reflected on the back end. Create a site that takes the user through a narrative using text, links, and multiple pages. <a href="/projects">More information here</a>.</p>

<h4 id="project-2-website-for-a-blank">project 2: website for a [blank]</h4>
<p>Students will conceptualize, plan, and design a multipage website using one of several provided topics. The project will build off of the weekly lessons and end at a design for a responsive website. Each students project will be unique in content and form but be based on the same set of requirements. <a href="/projects">More information here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="discussion-of-work">Discussion of Work</h3>
<p>You will need to take an active role in both the presentation and discussion of your work. We will review projects in a variety of ways and you are expected to be able to talk and write about your own work and give feedback to your peers about their work. The ability to discuss your work and other student’s work is a very important part of your education at Mason. Use this class to improve on those skills.</p>

<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>
<p>Your ability to communicate with me is of prime importance in this course. If you are going to be absent, late, or not have your work, it will be your best interest in communicating those things to me in advance. I do not need to know your reasons for being absent, late, or not having your work but I do need to know. A simple, short email will be fine.</p>

<p>The same goes for if you are struggling in this class or having other issues that are hindering your ability to complete work in this class. The more you keep me in the loop the more I can help you and adjust as needed.</p>

<h3 id="attendance">Attendance</h3>
<p>There is no specific attendance grade for this class, it is tied together with your engagement grade outlined below. However, if you miss four or more classes you will automatically fail the class unless you have communicated with me prior to the fourth absence.</p>

<h3 id="engagement">Engagement</h3>
<p>This course has an engagement policy. Your engagement will affect your final grade (and, by extension, the quality of your work). You are expected to actively and passionately take part in this course in the following ways.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Attend class meetings</li>
  <li>Create things and be prepared to show them on time.</li>
  <li>Make things thoughtfully, intentionally, and with intensity.</li>
  <li>Meet all deadlines for handing in work and process.</li>
  <li>Actively participate in critiques both in class and out of class.</li>
  <li>Be curious about making things and the things your classmates make.</li>
  <li>Care about yourself &amp; your work, your classmates &amp; their work, and this class.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>Grades will be based on your quizzes (10%), engagement (25%),  exercises (25%), and projects (40%).</p>

<h4 id="quizzes-10">Quizzes (10%)</h4>
<p>Each week will have a 5 question quiz that you can use any resources available to you on and take as many times as you want until the quiz is due.</p>

<h4 id="participation-25">Participation (25%)</h4>
<p>This percentage will be based on your engagement in the class. Be engaged in this course and its content and this should be an easy 25%.</p>

<h4 id="exercises-25">Exercises (25%)</h4>
<p>The exercises are meant to be quicker, skill building tasks that improve your projects and design knowledge.</p>

<h4 id="projects-40">Projects (40%)</h4>
<p>Each project will generate two different grades. One grade will be based on your week to week process and the second grade will be based on the final submission. At the end of the semester you will have 4 total project grades that are all weighted equally for this 50%.</p>

<h3 id="late-work">Late Work</h3>
<p>Late work will be accepted for three weeks after a deadline with the exception of the final project which will be due at the end of the semester. There is a section on the rubrics showing how late work is factored into the assignment grade.</p>

<h3 id="rubrics">Rubrics</h3>
<p>Rubrics are used to grade exercises, projects, and checkpoints. The rubrics are on the last pages of the PDF syllabus and tied to each submission on Blackboard. The rubrics are here to allow you to understand how work is graded and to reference while working to self-evaluate.</p>

<h3 id="late-work-1">Late Work</h3>
<p>Late work will be accepted for three weeks after a deadline with the exception of the final project which will be due at the end of the semester. There is a section on the rubrics showing how late work is factored into the assignment grade.</p>

<h3 id="weekly-schedule">Weekly Schedule</h3>
<p>Class is on Tuesdays from 1:30–4:10. Most days we will meet for the entire time but some weeks we will have individual meetings or end early. Some classes will be work days so make sure to bring things to work on each class. Unless otherwise specified, all work is due at the beginning of class.</p>

<p>A note&amp;emdash;Time management is an important skill to master and should be worked on all your classes. Staying up all night working is not a badge of honor, it typically means you didn’t budget your time correctly. Staying up all night isn’t healthy and making sure you are keeping yourself healthy is your first priority.</p>

<h3 id="semester-schedule">Semester Schedule</h3>
<p>The <a href="/schedule/">schedule</a> on this site is an outline of what we will be covering this spring with due dates. It is subject to additions, subtractions, and shifts.</p>

<h3 id="open-studio">Open Studio</h3>
<p>The design faculty will be hosting open studio hours in room 1023. When the open studio is open, you will have access to computers, a space to work, or get feedback and help from the faculty member in the room.

<h3 id="attendance-policies">Attendance Policies</h3>
<p>Students are expected to attend the class periods of the courses for which they register. In-class (including sections that meet online) participation is important not only to the individual student, but also to the class as a whole. Because class participation may be a factor in grading, instructors may use absence, tardiness, or early departure as de facto evidence of non-participation. Students who miss an exam with an acceptable excuse may be penalized according to the individual instructor’s grading policy, as stated in the course syllabus.</p>

<h3 id="honor-code">Honor Code</h3>
<p>To promote a stronger sense of mutual responsibility, respect, trust, and fairness among all members of the George Mason University Community and with the desire for greater academic and personal achievement, we, the student members of the university community, have set forth this Honor Code: Student Members of the George Mason University community pledge not to cheat, plagiarize, steal, or lie in matters related to academic work. <a href="https://oai.gmu.edu/mason-honor-code/">Honor Code</a></p>

<h3 id="commitment-to-diversity">Commitment to Diversity</h3>
<p>This class will be conducted as an intentionally inclusive community that celebrates diversity and welcomes the participation in the life of the university of faculty, staff and students who reflect the diversity of our plural society. All may feel free to speak and to be heard without fear that the content of the opinions they express will bias the evaluation of their academic performance or hinder their opportunities for participation in class activities. In turn, all are expected to be respectful of each other without regard to race, class, linguistic background, religion, political beliefs, gender identity, sex, sexual orientation, ethnicity, age, veteran’s status, or physical ability.</p>

<h3 id="statement-on-ethics-in-teaching-and-practicing-art-and-design">Statement on Ethics in Teaching and Practicing Art and Design</h3>
<p>As professionals responsible for the education of undergraduate and graduate art and design students, the faculty of the School of Art adheres to the ethical standards and practices incorporated in the professional Code of Ethics of our national accreditation organization, The National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD).</p>

<h3 id="anti-racism-statement">Anti-racism Statement</h3>
<p>I explicitly reject white supremacy and racism and am committed to equity, justice, and democracy in society, on campus, and within my classrooms. No matter the name or label, anti-Black and anti-Semitic, and racist thought and action are antithetical to my mission and values as an educator. I condemn the divisive and intimidating tactics of white supremacist views.</p>

<p>I recognize that systemic racism is pervasive within our society and institutions, and pledge to combat it through receiving critical feedback on how I can be more inclusive and being more self-aware of my privileged identities. Including the use of collective teaching, programming, scholarship, and service. I want you, Mason’s students, to know that I am committed to fostering a classroom where everyone can learn without the chilling effects of bigoted views.</p>

<p>I am determined to uphold the University’s mission, which states that, “We hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards as educators, scholars, and professionals,” and thus am committed to creating a culture of excellence, inclusion, and accessibility.</p>

<p>I welcome all members of our extended community regardless of their race, ethnicity, immigration status, religion, sexual identity, gender identity, socioeconomic status, political or institutional affiliation, and ability, and am fully dedicated to promoting a diversity of voices and views as an academic department.</p>

<p>I recognize that there is still much self- and systemic-work to be done to make the spaces of the University safe and hospitable to all and am committed to continuing to do that work. My door is open to any students seeking support or guidance.</p>

<h3 id="land-acknowledgment">Land Acknowledgment</h3>
<p>We acknowledge the Monacan Nation, including the Manahoac people, the traditional owners of the land and waters upon which our University stands.</p>

<h3 id="important-deadlines">Important Deadlines:</h3>
<p>Once the add and drop deadlines have passed, instructors do not have the authority to approve requests from students to add or drop/withdraw late. Requests for late adds (up until the last day of classes) must be made by the student in the School of Art office (or the office of the department offering the course), and generally are only approved in the case of a documented university error (such as a problem with financial aid being processed), LATE ADD fee will apply. Requests for non-selective withdrawals and retroactive adds (adds after the last day of classes) must be approved by the academic dean of the college in which the student’s major is located. For AVT majors, that is the CVPA Office of Academic Affairs in College Hall.</p>
